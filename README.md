# LEAP ORM for Kohana PHP Framework

Finally, an ORM for the Kohana PHP Framework that works with all major databases!

The Leap ORM is designed on the active record paradigm.  It provides a set of query builders that
make writing SQL statements easy.  Leap also provides a set of powerful database connection classes,
and utilizes a database connection pool to manage its resources.  Leap will also allow you to choose
which set of connection functions or classes you want to use...so...if your server is configured to use
PDO classes, you can configure Leap to use them...or....if you prefer to use PHP's standard functions,
you can choose them instead.

The classes in this library are well documented and are simple to use.  Visit [Spadefoot's Web site](http://orm.spadefootcode.com)
for information, examples, and tutorials on how to use these classes.
